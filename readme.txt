Preview your site at random page widths to test your Responsive design.

== Description ==

=Preview your site at random page widths to test your Responsive design.

WP Responsive Preview provides an additional previewing option when editing pages, post and other content types. It loads the preview within a randomly sized iframe to see how the design responds at a random width. It's great for testing how your responsive design performs.

This plugin is based entirley on [ish. from Brad Frost][http://bradfrostweb.com/demo/ish/] - a great standalone tool for previewing your site at random widths. His post does the best job of explaining the reasoning behind ish. (and therefore WP Responsive Preview).

"The real reasons for this tool is to educate and to facilitate a mental shift. Many clients, designers and developers get hung up on specific device widths, which is why this tool doesn’t include any such language, device chrome or anything like that. Ish. helps keep everyone focused on making a design that looks and functions great at any resolution."




== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'wp-responsive-preview' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
1. Activate the WP Responsive Preview plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Start Previewing!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I preview at a set size? =

Targeting specific widths is fraught with danger. The number of new devices being released month by month means that there are no longer 'safe' screen widths to target. WP Responsive Preview (and ish. - on which it is based) deliberately randomise the screen width in order to see what the design looks like at the 'in-between' stages.
