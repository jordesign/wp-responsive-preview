= Why can't I preview at a set size? =

Targeting specific widths is fraught with danger. The number of new devices being released month by month means that there are no longer 'safe' screen widths to target. WP Responsive Preview (and ish. - on which it is based) deliberately randomise the screen width in order to see what the design looks like at the 'in-between' stages.
